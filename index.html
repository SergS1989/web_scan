                    Dark spruce forest frowned on either side
                    the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped
                    by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, 
                    and they seemed to lean towards each other, 
                    black and ominous, in the fading light. 
                    A vast silence reigned over the land. 
                    The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without 
                    movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was 
                    not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of 
                    laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any 
                    sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of 
                    the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking 
                    of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful 
                    and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the 
                    futility of life and the effort of life. It was the 
                    Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
